v0 Django Respo Created: Respo created, Django Project

                            Files Changed:
                            * Installation of Django & its components
                            * venv
                            * README & Version_Info files

                            Objectives:
                            * Basic Intro to Django/build upon previous builds/improve concepts & modularity for
                            sites & future projects

--v1 Basic Intro: will be working on basic info such as polls. Once that is done will be working on a more full stack dev
                    of a site. Will include on any changes to come

                    Files Changed:
                    Terminal functions -> python manage.py startapp polls
                        * new file polls/views.py
                            - imported HttpResponse, and made a function to return a statement once the user was on the file
                        * Updated polls/urls.py
                            - Try/except statement on importing views.py
                            - connected it via urlpatterns
                        * Django0/urls.py updated config (which allows the user to access the /polls tab
                            - just updated django.urls from -> from django.urls import path to from django.urls import include, path
                            - added the path to polls.urls @ urlpatterns -> path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),

                    Summary:
                        Once the site starts up and open up the link you can add polls/ @ the url to visit the polls/views.py info
                    which will print the 'Hello this is the poll index' response.

                    Objectives:
                        Will begin on working on a db, a vital important factor for a full stack site dev. If your planning
                        on making your site as effective as possible.
