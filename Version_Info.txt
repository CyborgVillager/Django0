                            sites & future projects

v1 Basic Intro: will be working on basic info such as polls. Once that is done will be working on a more full stack dev
                    of a site. Will include on any changes to come

                    Files Changed:
                    Terminal functions -> python manage.py startapp polls
                        * new file polls/views.py
                            - imported HttpResponse, and made a function to return a statement once the user was on the file
                        * Updated polls/urls.py
                            - Try/except statement on importing views.py

                            - added the path to polls.urls @ urlpatterns -> path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),

                    Summary:
                        Once the site starts up and open up the link you can add polls/ @ the url to visit the polls/views.py info
                    which will print the 'Hello this is the poll index' response.

                    Objectives:
                        Will begin on working on a db, a vital important factor for a full stack site dev. If your planning
